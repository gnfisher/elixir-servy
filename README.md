# Servy

This is code written while working through the [Pragmatic Studio's Elixir
course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elixir).

You'll also find exercises from [Programming Elixir by Dave Thomas](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/) mixed in
here.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `servy` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:servy, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/servy](https://hexdocs.pm/servy).
